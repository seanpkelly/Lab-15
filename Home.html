        <p><b><h10>So my name is Sean Kelly, </h10></b>and this little website is about me and work I do, and the work I've done.</p>
        <p>As a poet, and author of fiction I've had work featured in:</p>
        <p><b>Vice</b></p>
        <p><b>Southern Living</b></p>
        <p><b>The Wall Street Journal</b></p>
        <p><b>The Detroit Free Press</b></p>
        <p><b>The Paris Review</b></p>
        <p><b>The Macomb Daily</b></p>
        <p><b>The Western Herald</b></p>
        <p>Just to name a few publications.</p>
        <p>My style is free form poetry that reflects personal experience of loss.</P>
        <p>Yes, all of my poetry is either about love or death. That's the way it goes sometimes.</p>
        <br>
        <p><b><h10>I got into Web Development</h10></b> by having friends who had gotten into the field and falling in love with it.</p>
        <p>They were constantly telling me that it was a field where I would be appreciated for my intellect.</p>
        <p>I myself had been looking to transition into a field where I was both compensated more appropriately,</p>
        <p>and able to grow more easily towards my goals. Web Development and the entire world of tech allows that.</p>
        <p>As I work towards those goals I can pictrue myself in a career where I have insurance, benefits, paid time off.</p>
        <p>The reason I'm putting every ounce of me into the Grand Circus bootcamp is not merely a pride thing.</p>
        <p>It's just as much to do with the fact that I really want to be a part of this industry, debugging and</p>
        <p>writing code for a living. That feeling makes all of this worth it.</p>
        <br>
        <p><b><h10>Where I come from</h10></b> is as important to me as the people I grew up with.</p>
        <p>I was born in Sarasota, Florida and immediately my parents moved us to Denver, Colorado where they first met and lived before they moved to Florida.</p>
        <p>After a short amount of time in Colorado my parents moved us to Detroit, Michigan where my father was born and raised.</p>
        <p>From there I spent my life living in seven different homes from the city to the a 60 acre horse farm and back to the city.</p>
        <p>My life has always been in flux, and most of it spent being raised by my incredible single mother who would do things I still</p>
        <p>can't fathom myself being able to do.</p>
        <p>Simply put, my Mother is one amazing woman. With that being said, my hometown as it was, is Saint Clair Shores, Michigan.</p>
        <p>Saint Clair Shores is where I went to high school, it's where I spent the most amount of time during my youth and it's where my Grandparents live.</p>
